### Enhancements implemented:

Implemented the following function:

|Action|Format, Examples|
|--------|----------|
| list | ```list``` |
| Search| ```search /title /<title><br>search /status /<status><br>search /severity /<severityNum><br>search /owner /<owner><br>search /deadline /<deadlineDateString(dd-MM-yyyy)>``` |
  
 The ```list``` function was created to allow different users to view the total list of defects present in the IT Logger
 It was subsequently enhanced to perform listing based on different types & category such as severity, deadline and etc. It is a must have feature in for usage.
 
 The ```search``` function was created to allow users to look up all defects present in the IT Logger that meets certain search criteria. The list of which can be found   above.
